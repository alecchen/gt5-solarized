                  "gt5" or "where has my diskspace gone?"
               \___________________________________________/

Overview
~~~~~~~~
   Years ago, I was proud to own an 80MHz, 16MB RAM PC with a huge 512MB
   harddisk. But even on this incredibly huge harddisk, my diskspace seemed
   to disappear over time. So I wrote a little tool to find out where all my
   diskspace had gone: I called it "gettree", as it showed all files in a
   directory and also calculated the size of subtrees.  Over the years, the
   OS I used changed, but the problem stayed. Using Linux, there are some
   tools to deal with it, but I couldn't find anything that was clearly laid
   out, intuitive to browse, and doesn't need X-Windows.

Features
~~~~~~~~
   * displays the diskspace used by files and directories within a directory
   * displays what has happened since gt5 last ran (see screenshot below)
   * optionally provides links to the files, so you can also browse them
   * displays entries with their size and the percentage of their parent
   * omission of small files/directories to keep the results readable
   * easy browsing through subdirectories, using the cursor-keys 

Implementation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   I tried different ways to do the job and settled on a small shell-script:
      * highly 'portable', as it only depends on some GNU-utilities
      * common textbrowsers are used to navigate through the results
      * runs on console, xterm or remotely over ssh

Navigation
~~~~~~~~~~
   If you are familiar with textbrowsers there is nothing to say: gt5 produces
   an HTML file; go browse it. Below are the most important keys for gt5 used
   with links/links2/elinks/lynx:

Usage
~~~~~

   Syntax: gt5 [ dir | file | dir file | file file2 ] [options]
        dir           the directory you want to check for space used
        file/file2    existing du-logs (du -akx $DIR #gz/bz2/plain)
      --cut-at float  don't show files below 'float'% of its parent,
                      default is 0.1, use values between 0.01 and 30
      --diff-dir d    use dir d to store diffs between runs [~/.gt5-diffs]
      --discard       do not save this one for diffs, discard it
      --link-files    insert links to files for direct access
      --max-depth i   ignore anything deeper than i directories [5]
      --max-lines i   only consider the i biggest files [10000]
      --no-diffs      use this if you really do not want diffs
      --save-as file  DEPRECATED, use 'du', see manpage
      --save-state    overwrite a previous '--discard'
      --with-mounts   also look below mountpoints
