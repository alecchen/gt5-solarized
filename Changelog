    * just some minor fixes in the manpage

24.01.2007 version 1.3c

09.05.2006 version 1.3a

08.12.2005 version 1.3

    * added diffs: gt5 shows where diskspace has been occupied since last run
    * added colors to show bigger, smaller and new files at the first sight
      (in case you use a textbrowser that honors a document's coloring)
    * gt5 now can also show du-logs generated with 'du -ak /some/dir'
    * removed support for w3m, (see manpage)
    * wrote a manpage for gt5

17.11.2005 version 1.2f

    * added fallback to use lynx/w3m
      (order: elinks links links2 lynx w3m)

    * fixed permissions for gawk/links if build systemwide
    * added --get-elinks and --get-links2, as requested
    * changed the default to ignore mountet filesystems

15.09.2005 version 1.2d

    * added Makefile to be able to install gt5 via toast
    * added LC_ALL=POSIX to override system environment

20.08.2005 version 1.2c

    * improved cutting technics: --cut-at / --max-depth / --max-lines
    * more reliable removing of temporary files trough 'trap'
    * fixed sort order of links-versions within --get-links
    * check for the availability of gawk
    * better escaping of filenames 

14.04.2005 version 1.1

    * Fixed a bug triggered by reiserfs where directories can have zero size:
      If only one subdirectory exists, parent and child have equal size. They
      were sorted incorrectly, which rendered the parent 'unbrowseable'.
    * Fixed a bug triggered by HTML anchors being caseinsensitive. So directo-
      ries whose names only differ in case were (of course) indistinguishable.
    * renamed '--keep-as' to '--save-as' as I allways mix them up. In fact
      both switches are accepted.
    * temporary files are now compressed using gzip to minimize diskusage

30.10.2004 version 1.0

    * first public release (gt5 is feature complete)
    * I used it on my own for several weeks now
